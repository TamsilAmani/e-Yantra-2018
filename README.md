# e-Yantra-2018
Line Following Robot

The codes were implemented as part of the 'e-Yantra' competition organized by IIT-Bombay in 2018. 
Different tasks were given and we had to code their solutions.

These codes are maily related to color detection and line following using arduino and Raspberry Pi.

The final code (in Task 4) was used to drive the robot.
